/// Blast Sequence Source implementation for the Sequence Read Archive databases.
///
/// BlastSeqSrc is an abstract data type used by Blast as a layer between
/// the Blast engine and the physical source of biological sequence data.
/// This implementation of BlastSeqSrc uses the SRA (Sequence Read Archive)
/// databases to extract and convert the nucleotide sequence data and
/// provide it to Blast through the standard BlastSeqSrc interface.
///
/// This is the top-level header file for the SRA BlastSeqSrc library.
/// It contains the main function for initializing the SRA BlastSeqSrc
/// object, which takes care of setting up the BlastSeqSrc with all the
/// correct function pointers and data structures.

// ==========================================================================//

// Blast includes

#include <common/ncbi_export.h>
